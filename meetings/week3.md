# Week 3

Our task had been to learn more or less the essence of libGDX with a tutorial page. Everyone had to do it. We also gave some tasks, like learning how to map better and actually make one. Our idea was to learn to code early so we can get an early rough build, which would have the map, collision, and “boat” controlled by a mouse which would follow. It was planned for week 5. We also worked on documentation, mainly the requirements one.
