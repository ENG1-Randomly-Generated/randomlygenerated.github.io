## Outline and justification of software engineering methods

Our team has taken a plan-driven approach to completing this project. Having a plan is always important to keep our eyes on the end-goal, hence we have our own milestones, on top of weekly tasks to complete for each member of the team. To make sure that everyone is doing that, we have regular meetings every week, at minimum of two, to make sure that everyone is sticking to the plan and doing their tasks, and to see where we need to advocate more ressources, while also using that time to polish any documentation. However, we are doing our best to be flexible. As we all are university students, we all are aware that something may suddenly pop up in our lives that complicate the amount we can dedicate to the project. We have the plan, but if something needs to be changed, we cannot stick religiously to the plan.

To help our development, we use a variety of different tools and programs to help us keep all our work together. The most important one for the documentation aspect is Google Drive, along all of its extensions. Google Drive allows us to link all of our files together, whether it be documents or even code (although we have a better tool for that one). It also allows anyone we give access to the ability to view it, which is great for sharing with clients if there is a need for that. Along with the extensions, our main tool for writing the documents is Google Docs, which I like to call “better Word”. It has all the needed features and allows multiple people to look at it and write on it at the same time, which is a great feature when working on one as a group. It also allows us to view the history of the document, which can be useful to see who has been doing what. While Office 365 type programs can serve as an alternative, and there is a “Word Online” version of it, it simply lacks the same accessibility and ease of use that Google Docs/Drives has. Additionally, we were all already familiar with it.

We mentioned earlier a better tool for storing our code. The program we used for that is Git. It allows us to essentially share our code online. A subsidiary of Git that we use is GitHub. We use Github as the “Google Drives” for coding, as it allows everyone to upload their code to a main branch, or create their own branch to work on their own section, keeping it to merge later. All of that is done online on their website directly, an alternative to using the Git programming but which works in a relatively similar way, if not more accessible and easy to understand. It’s a service used by many developers, and we’ve certainly understood why.

The multi-branching approach helps us approach our more task-oriented way, and allows each member to view the code of someone else, so we can all agree what’ll be the best solution for the final project. While each team member knows what they are doing, we can create issues and tickets that members can pick up if they have extra time or are doing something related to it, which helps us even more with organising the next set of tasks to give out.

With Github, we are also using GitHub Pages, which allows us to host our own website for a more public view of our project, without the lengthy and hard process of making our own website. 
Having all these tools is great, but the main thing that is needed in any project or team is communication. Unfortunately, with COVID-19, there are no real ways to have a lab to work in together in person. And even if we did, it wouldn’t be enough. The main program we used to communicate with each other is Discord. Discord is a tool that can be used for both text and vocal communication. It allows us to create channels and categories to organize our discussions in the proper areas, or share documents and links that may be useful to us. It’s a cornerstone of our project as without it and its organizational structure, we wouldn’t be able to organize ourselves well enough. The classic alternatives would be Zoom or Skype, but they are both very limited in their functionality, of being “meeting” type programs and don't allow users to properly communicate between said meetings. This is why we all thought that Discord would be the perfect platform for us.

## Team's approach to team organisation

Since we are a group of students where all our work is being done remotely, and with one of our members being in a largely different timezone it required us to be quite flexible with how we were organised as a group.

To be effective, we set out to accomplish a few preliminary goals. Firstly, we had ice-breaking activities so we could find out what people were best at doing and also seeing how we interacted with each other as a team. This proved useful as it allowed us to delegate our roles out easily and efficiently, although we didn’t always strictly follow the roles that we set out for ourselves, and people gravitated towards what initially wasn’t expected, but ended up performing well at the task. So at the base we had our set roles, and we used that to our advantage by assigning tasks to people who had the most appropriate role.  
Furthermore, we also organised set dates occuring every week where we would hold meetings to discuss the project as a team, we also held sub meetings where people who were accomplishing similar tasks would meet earlier and work together to bounce ideas off each other and help develop the project further.

These meetings provided some core functionality to how we organise ourselves and allowed us to be the most productive.  
Firstly, it allowed us as a team to make large, educated, decisions about the approaches / tasks we set out to do, and gave everyone a chance to raise concerns and resolve any conflicts before we went ahead and implemented that item.  
We also used them to catch-up and check progress with what people had been working since the last meeting. Enabling us to document what people were working on in the minutes and let the group reflect on what was produced and see if any improvements could be made. This provided a good incentive to create high-quality work, acting like a positive feedback loop.
The most important factor from these meetings was giving us a solid platform to delegate tasks out which aided us heavily in completing the majority of the project. After discussing a task, breaking it down in the process, we each would choose a task. In some cases two people would collaborate on the same task, which was useful for larger and complex tasks and allowed us to complete them within a set timeframe we assigned it.  
Overall, these meetings helped us focus on what needed attention, where we would define clear goals, keep within scope, and maintain a high level of efficiency throughout the project life.

We also used our communication software as a platform for any discussions that occurred outside those meetings and was available to us 24/7. So if people did have issues with their allotted task, another  team member could jump in and help out which helped us maintain productivity.
To compliment our communication, we used our website as a hub to help us organise the team. It Provides a quick way to access documents and meeting minutes which helped us develop the project without having to go out of our way to search for the documents and it was all indexed.
